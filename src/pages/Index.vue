            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>For more than 60 years we’ve been developing and producing seamless high-pressure steel cylinders on our
              company site in
              Apolda, Thuringia, Germany. High-pressure steel cylinders are used for the storage and transportation of
              compressed,
              liquefied and dissolved gases.</p>
            <p>The field of application of our products ranges from industrial gases, healthcare and safety equipment, the
              food and
              beverage industry, fire extinguishing systems, to breathing apparatuses and scuba diving cylinders.</p>
            <p>Our production program encompasses seamless high-pressure steel cylinders with the following parameters:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc mb-4">
              <li>Outer diameter: 83 mm to 267 mm</li>
              <li>Water capacity: 0,7 liters to 80,0 liters</li>
              <li>Test pressure: 250 to 450 bars</li>
              <li>Bottom shape: convex, concave, with foot ring</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beside our standard production program, we develop and produce high-pressure steel cylinders conforming
              your special
              requirements. Upon request we’re happy to completely assemble your cylinders including valves, valve
              protection and
              other accessories.</p>

            <h2>Company's history</h2>
            <p>Dating back to the early thirties of the last century, fire extinguishers and fire-fighting equipment have
              been produced
              on our site in Apolda, a small town located in Thuringia, Germany, situated within the triangle of the
              surrounding and
              famous cities of Weimar, Jena, and Naumburg.</p>
            <p>Already in 1957, the production of high-pressure steel cylinders was started in order to extent the product
              range to
              other fields of technical applications.</p>
            <p>In the 1990 the company underwent a comprehensive restructuring process, accompanied by major investments
              in most modern
              manufacturing and testing equipment. Subsequently the company was certified according to DIN EN ISO
              9001:2008 for the
              first time in 1993.</p>
            <p>Since 2016 eurocylinder systems AG is part of the diversified industrial group Serafin based in Munich.</p>
            <p>Today eurocylinder systems AG has an annual production capacity of more than 500,000 cylinders,
              manufactured on two
              production lines, and is among the top-5 of the European steel cylinder manufacturers.</p>
